How do you approach JavaScript's asynchronous programming model, and what are your preferred methods for handling callbacks and promises to avoid common pitfalls like callback hell?


#### Answer:

My approach to JavaScript's asynchronous programming model is to understand and embrace the event-driven, non-blocking nature of the language. Here are some strategies I use to handle callbacks and promises:


1. **Understanding Promises:** I use Promises because they provide a more readable and manageable way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent the eventual completion or",6.0

JavaScript's event loop, also known as the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, is fundamentally different from traditional threading models like those found in C# and Java. Here's a breakdown of how it works and its impact on performance:

1. Event loop: The event loop is a single-threaded loop that processes a queue of events and callbacks. When an",0.0

Certainly! Here's how the existing code can be refactored using ES6 syntax and the `fetch` API for web requests, along with added unit tests using Jest.

First, let's refactor the JavaScript code for web requests:

```javascript
// Using fetch API with async/await
async function fetchWithRetry(url, retries, delay) {

Certainly! Here are the modifications for readability and additional functionality:

```javascript
// Start of the enhanced function
function trackEventLoopEvents(eventNames) {
  if (!Array.isArray(eventNames)) {
    throw new Error('Expected an array of event names');
  }

  // Converts a string array to an array of objects
